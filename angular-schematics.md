# Angular Schematics

## Tools

### Schematics CLI

The Schematics CLI provides the `schematics` command, which is similar to Angular's `ng generate` command, but is not dependent on Angular. The tool can be used to create new schematics.

#### Installation

```bash
npm install @angular-devkit/schematics-cli
```

#### New Project

```bash
schematics blank $name
```
